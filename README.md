# Daily Sobh Sindhi News DSA

## Description
This is a project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course at the Sindh Madressatul Islam University. The project uses python to scrape data from the [Daily Sobh](https://dailysobh.com) website and store it in a database. The title or headline of the news from the data is taken as x and topic of the headline as type is then used to train four different machine learning models i.e. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine using four different counting techinques i.e. TF-IDF, Hash Matrix and Count Vectorizer.

Aside form four different machine learning models, the project also uses a deep learning model i.e. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to train the data. The LSTM model is trained using the headline or title from the data and the topic and of the news as y. The model is then used to predict the topic of an news based on the headline or title.
